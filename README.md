# Project Alpha

Project Alpha is a self-hosted business operations application for managing clients, quotes, contracts, invoices, payments, expenses, receipts, mileage, and supporting documents.

It is developed by [Ledge Top Technologies LLC](https://ledgetoptechnologies.com/) and is currently used in production by Ledge Top Technologies and Ledge Top Drone Services. The project is stable enough for day-to-day internal use, but it is still evolving; bugs and feature requests are tracked publicly in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ledgetoptechnologies/Project-Alpha/issues).

> Project Alpha is business software, not accounting, tax, or legal advice. Review your own operational and regulatory requirements before relying on it for third-party hosting.

## Highlights

- Regular, long-term, and on-demand quotes and contracts
- Quote-to-contract and contract-to-invoice workflows
- Scheduled recurring invoices with downtime catch-up
- Manual on-demand invoice generation
- Fixed-price and hourly billing
- Stripe Checkout, Payment Intents, webhooks, and reconciliation
- Offline payment recording and partial-payment tracking
- Tokenized public links for document review, signing, and payment
- Clients, organizations, projects, and automatically generated job codes
- Item library, discounts, deposits, taxes, and custom document fields
- Expenses, receipts, vendors, mileage, forms, and financial reporting
- Role-based permissions, per-user overrides, optional TOTP with dismissible reminders, and audit logs
- Built-in workforce, server-authoritative timekeeping, approvals, and employee-pay modules
- Docker Compose deployment with migrate, web, worker, cron, and MySQL services
- Prebuilt images published through GitHub Container Registry

## Document Workflow

Project Alpha supports three primary document families:

| Family | Intended use | Invoice behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Regular | One-time work | A regular invoice is normally created with the contract |
| Long-term | Recurring services or retainers | Invoices are generated from the active contract schedule |
| On-demand | Work billed only when needed | Invoices are generated manually from the active contract |

The usual regular workflow is:

```text
Quote -> Contract -> Invoice -> Payment
```

Long-term and on-demand workflows branch after contract activation. See [Document Workflow](docs/DOCUMENT_WORKFLOW.md) for statuses, automatic actions, public-link behavior, and examples.

## Current Scope

Project Alpha currently targets a self-hosted deployment operated for one business. The schema includes organizations and organization-aware permissions, but the application is not yet offered as a fully isolated, hosted multi-tenant service.

Current boundaries include:

- Public tokenized document links instead of persistent client accounts
- Responsive web UI, but no native mobile application or installable PWA
- Operational income and expense reporting, but not a complete general ledger
- Stripe is implemented; other payment processors are not yet available
- Deployment, backups, email, and payment credentials remain the operator's responsibility

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2
- A host that can pull public images from `ghcr.io`
- Ports and reverse-proxy configuration appropriate for your environment

### Start the published images

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ledgetoptechnologies/Project-Alpha.git
   cd Project-Alpha
   ```

2. In `docker-compose.yml`, replace both database `changeme` passwords:

   - `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
   - `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`

3. Pull and start the stack:

   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Open <http://localhost:1627>. On a clean database, PA displays its first-time setup screen. Create the initial administrator with your own email, username, and password; PA has no default administrator credential.

5. Complete the application settings:

   - **System**: organization identity, application URL, timezone, and sender profile
   - **Billing**: Stripe keys, net terms, payment methods, and surcharge preferences
   - **Email**: SMTP connection and sender information
   - **Documents**: terms, custom fields, automatic document creation, and link lifetime
   - **Notifications**: cron and invoice-email options

The one-shot `migrate` service initializes and validates the database before web or cron can start. Project Alpha 0.5.0 is a destructive database reset and cannot upgrade a 0.4.x database in place; follow the [0.5.0 reset runbook](docs/0.5.0-database-reset.md).

### Administrator recovery

If an active administrator loses their password and email reset is unavailable, run this from the Compose project directory:

```bash
docker compose exec web php bin/admin-recovery.php admin@example.com
```

The identifier may be the administrator username or email. PA prints one temporary password, revokes existing sessions and reset codes, and forces a password change at the next login. It refuses non-admin, inactive, ambiguous, or unknown accounts.

Reset TOTP only when it is also lost:

```bash
docker compose exec web php bin/admin-recovery.php admin@example.com --reset-totp
```

That explicit option removes the existing TOTP enrollment and requires a new enrollment immediately after the temporary password is changed. Both recovery operations are audited.

### Staging

Staging definitions are intentionally host-owned rather than tracked. When a
staging stack is needed, copy `docker-compose.yml` to the staging host and edit
that copy to use the `:dev` and `:cron` images, port `1628`, `APP_ENV: staging`,
and staging-only passwords. Deploy it from a separate directory so its named
volumes cannot collide with production.

## Local Development

Build the current checkout using the same tags referenced by the canonical
Compose file, then start it normally:

```bash
docker build --target test -t ghcr.io/ledgetoptechnologies/project-alpha:latest .
docker build --target cron -t ghcr.io/ledgetoptechnologies/project-alpha:cron-latest .
docker compose up -d
```

Running `docker compose pull` restores the published images afterward.

Useful checks:

```bash
composer install
composer test
docker compose run --rm migrate \
  php /var/www/src/migrations/run_migrations.php --dry-run --verbose
```

The production images use PHP 8.5. Composer currently targets PHP 8.3.31 for dependency resolution and permits PHP 8.1 or newer.

## Architecture

| Layer | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Web runtime | PHP 8.5 with Apache |
| Application | Custom PHP routing and controllers; no full-stack framework |
| Database | MySQL 8 with PDO |
| Templates | PHP views plus Twig components |
| Frontend | Server-rendered HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript |
| PDFs | Dompdf |
| Payments | Stripe Checkout, Payment Intents, webhooks, and reconciliation |
| Background work | Dedicated worker and cron containers |
| Deployment | Multi-stage Docker image and Docker Compose |

All HTTP requests enter through `public/index.php`. Application source is under `src/`, the immutable fresh-install schema is `database/baseline.sql`, and sequential forward migrations live under `database/migrations/`.

## Scheduled Operations

The cron image runs recurring invoice generation, backups, contract expiration, public-link expiration, audit schedules, invoice reminders, Stripe reconciliation, and merchant-rate synchronization. AutoPay is an unavailable beta foundation and is not scheduled or exposed.

See [Cron Service](cron/README.md) for the installed schedule and [Recurring Invoices](docs/RECURRING_INVOICES_SETUP.md) for billing behavior.

## Security and Operations

Project Alpha includes application-level controls such as CSRF validation, prepared database access, rate limiting, optional TOTP with stronger recommendations for privileged users, role-based authorization, encrypted storage for configured secrets, audit logging, security headers, and webhook signature validation when a Stripe webhook secret is configured.

Operators remain responsible for:

- HTTPS and reverse-proxy configuration
- Unique passwords and credential rotation
- Protecting the persistent encryption key and backup volume
- Restricting network access to MySQL
- Testing migrations and restoring backups
- Keeping container images and dependencies current
- Reviewing application logs without committing credentials or customer data

Report security vulnerabilities privately as described in [Security Policy](docs/SECURITY.md).

## Repository Workflow

- Report reproducible bugs through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ledgetoptechnologies/Project-Alpha/issues).
- Never include credentials, payment data, or identifiable customer information in an issue.
- `main` is protected and requires a pull request with passing checks.
- `dev` publishes the staging images; `main` publishes the production images.
- Testing should be proportional to the change, with browser verification for user-facing workflows.
