- This project is a work in progress.
- The purpose of this project is to create a working docker container for businesses so that they have a tool to manage client info, create quotes, contracts, and invoices and eventually 
once connected to a smtp server send emails with the click of a button.

- There is no telling how long this project will take as I am a full time student and business owner.

- This project is inspired by the GitHub Repo SolidInvoice/SolidInvoice, however, no files are being directly taken from SolidInvoice.
