## Historical Records

The following files document earlier implementation passes, audits, or plans. They are useful context but are not current operating instructions:

- [Implementation Summary - May 6, 2026](IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
- [Supplemental Audit Findings - June 16, 2026](supplemental_audit_findings.md)
- [Comprehensive Plan - June 21, 2026](pa-comprehensive-plan.md)
- [Production Readiness Assessment - June 21, 2026](pa-production-readiness-assessment.md)
- [CI/CD Next Steps - June 23, 2026](CI-CD-NEXT-STEPS.md)

When a historical record conflicts with the application, current source code, `database/baseline.sql`, active migrations, Docker files, and the current guides above take precedence.

## Documentation Rules

- Do not commit passwords, API keys, tokens, customer information, private IP addresses, or production-only operational details.
- Prefer links to one authoritative guide instead of copying the same instructions into several files.
- Mark point-in-time audits and plans as historical once their implementation window closes.
- Update documentation in the same pull request as behavior changes.
